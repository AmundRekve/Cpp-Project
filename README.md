## Introduction
This repository contains a small, menu‑driven C++ console application for managing real‑estate–related data. It models zones/areas, properties/listings, and customers, and supports basic tasks like creating entries, viewing details, and writing/reading data to and from simple .DTA files.

## Small explanation
The code provides a simple, file‑based system for managing real‑estate data by allowing the creation and viewing of residential property listings with attributes such as type, identifiers, dates, size, number of rooms, price, and descriptions, all handled through console input and stored or retrieved from files. It organizes these listings into numbered zones, supporting the addition of new zones, listing existing ones, and importing or exporting zone data through straightforward file formats. The system also maintains a basic customer registry where each customer has a unique identifier and can be added, listed, updated, deleted, or associated with reports of the property listings they are interested in.
